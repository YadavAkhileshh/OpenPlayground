Players navigate under time pressure while avoiding AI-controlled enemies, collecting power-ups, and exploring through a fog-of-war system. Features intelligent pathfinding logic, randomized map generation each round, adaptive difficulty scaling, and seamless restart mechanics for a highly replayable experience.",
