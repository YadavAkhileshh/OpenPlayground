# ⚔️ Dungeon Crawler JS

A procedurally generated, tile-based rogue-lite RPG built entirely with **Vanilla JavaScript** and the **HTML5 Canvas API**. 

This project was developed for **ecwoc26** to demonstrate complex algorithmic logic in a frontend environment without the use of external frameworks or libraries.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Procedural Level Generation:** Uses a *Drunkard’s Walk* algorithm to ensure every floor is unique and reachable.
- **Entity-Component Architecture:** A custom-built system for managing players, enemies, and items.
- **Dynamic Camera System:** A viewport-based rendering system that follows the player across large maps (50x50 tiles).
- **Turn-Based Combat:** Logic for calculating damage variance, health tracking, and death states.
- **Reactive UI:** An overlay system that tracks HP, Floor level, and provides a real-time combat log.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Map Generation Logic
The dungeon is generated by simulating a "drunk walker" that moves randomly across a grid. Every time it moves into a "Wall" tile, it converts it into a "Floor" tile. This continues until 40% of the map is carved out, ensuring organic, cavern-like structures.

### Rendering Engine
Instead of DOM manipulation (which is slow for games), this project uses a single `<canvas>` element.
- **Layer 1:** Background and Floor/Wall tiles.
- **Layer 2:** Interactive elements (Stairs).
- **Layer 3:** Entities (Player and Goblins).
- **Layer 4:** UI Overlay (HTML/CSS).

### Enemy AI
The current AI utilizes a Manhattan Distance calculation to track the player. If the player enters the "aggro radius," the enemy moves towards the player's coordinates using a simple axis-alignment logic.
