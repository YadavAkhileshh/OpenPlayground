# Day 01 – Drunken Walk

This sketch is an implementation of the classic **Drunken Walk** algorithm,
a foundational concept in generative art and creative coding.

The walker starts from the center of the canvas and moves one step at a time
in a random direction, leaving behind an organic, unpredictable path.

## Concept
The Drunken Walk demonstrates how simple rules combined with randomness
can create emergent and visually interesting patterns.

## Techniques Used
- HTML Canvas API
- Randomness
- Incremental position updates
- HSL color variation

## Output
Each run produces a unique pattern, emphasizing the non-deterministic
nature of generative systems.
